1. Generic
  1.1. Your work involves using GStreamer can you tell us something about GStreamer? Anything else you want to add or share?
  1.2. Developed any application using GStreamer ?
  1.3. Used Command line tools for the quick testing of GStreamer pipelines ?
  1.4. Any experience in Linux Audio/Video sub-system internals and frameworks like, ALSA, V4L2 internals and driver development.
  1.5. Worked on challenges in the past on Audio/Video performance measurement ?
  1.6. Audio/Video tuning and code optimization to achieve maximum throughput.
2. What is bin, what is a pipeline, is pipeline a bin?
   >A> A bin is a container for a collection of elements. A pipeline is a top-level bin. It provides a bus for the application and manages the synchronization for its children.
3. What is src pad? what is sink pad? Buffers are traveling from src pad to sink pad.
4. Element states in GStreamer ? NULL, READY, PAUSE, PLAYING.
5. How does communication happen between plugin and application?
6. What is difference between request pad vs sometimes pad ?
7. What is difference between stream time and running time ?
8. How can we inject data from outside world (another application) to GStreamer and vice versa ?
9. Dynamic pad and request pad
10. Caps negotiation
11. what is pre-rolling
12. Capture -> encoded -> stream-out how pre-rolling will be done?
13. How Audio Video sync? and how clock is getting sync, sync=true?
14. base time ? running time? stream time ?
15. Latency  of pipeline?
16. Gst messege, bus, event, ?
17. What is appsrc and appsink ?
18. 720p I422 frame size ?
19. What is need of tee element ? Please explain using sample pipeline.
20. Difference between fakesink and fakevideosink
21. PTS and DTS
22. On pausing pipeline how is event propagated in pipeline
23. ffmpeg
24. Developed any GStremaer plugin from scractch ? Plugin architecture
25. GStreamer application development
    25.1 Top level coding steps to develop app for below pipeline
         gst-launch-1.0  videotestsrc ! capsfilter ! autovideosink ts-offset=10
