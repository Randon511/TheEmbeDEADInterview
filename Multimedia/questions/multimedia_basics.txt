1. What is difference between YUV and RGB ?  Why there will be need of YUV color format apart from RGB?
   >A>
   YUV: support different modes:
        Packed: One memory region storing all components (Y, U and V)
        Semiplanar: One memory region for Y component and one for UV components
        Planar: One memory region for each component
    Each memory region storing a frame component (Y, U or V) is called a plane
2. What are different color spaces like RGB, YUV ? How would YUV pixel values look like for a green,
   blue, red, black and white color pixels for suppose 8 bit per color space?
3. Chrominance and Luminance
4. What are various image formats? What are 4:4:4, 4:2:2 etc. Sampling ?
5. What is difference between planar, semiplanar and multiplanar ?

6. Advantage of YUV over RGB format
7. YUV420, YUV422, YUV444 chroma subsampling schemes understanding and single frame size calculation
    >A>
    YUV420 - 1 Cb & 1 Cr samples per 4 luma samples
    YUV422 - 2 Cb & 2 Cr samples per 4 luma samples
    YUV444 - 4 Cb & 4 Cr samples per 4 luma samples

    Size of 1920 * 1080
    YUV420 8-bit ==> 1920 * 1080 * (1 + 2/4) ==> 1920 * 1080 * 1.5
    YUV422 8-bit ==> 1920 * 1080 * (1 + 4/4) ==> 1920 * 1080 * 2
    YUV444 8-bit ==> 1920 * 1080 * (1 + 8/4) ==> 1920 * 1080 * 3
8. YUV sampling formats? YUV420, YUV422 and YUV444? How do they look like? Can you draw a picture?
9. What is Framerate in Video ? Can you convert 30FPS(NTSC) or 25FPS(PAL) to 24FPS(Cinema screen)?
    >A> 30FPS up-sampling by 4 ->120FPS down-sampling by 5 -> 24FPS  - Either drop frames or slow
        down the playback
10. What is significance of A, B & C in YUVA:B:C chroma-subsampling formats ?
11. What is difference between YUV420 and YUV411 chroma-subsampling schemes ?
12. What are Integer and Fractional framerate ? What is the need for fractional framerate ?
13. What is Chroma sub-sampling ?
14. What are color spaces? RGB? YCbCr? YUV? Why YCbCr or YUV?
15. Progressive vs Interlaced scanning
16. NTSC, PAL, SD, HD, Full HD, 4K, DCI 4K and 8K – Exact width x height for each one.
17. Analog video vs Digital Video
18. Aspect Ratio
19. What is PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio)?
