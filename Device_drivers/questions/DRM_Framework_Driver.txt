1. DRM and KMS - Definition
>A>
    - DRM stands for Direct Rendering Manager and was introduced to deal with graphic cards embedding GPUs
    - KMS stands for Kernel Mode Setting and is a sub-part of the DRM API
    - KMS provide a way to configure the display pipeline of a graphic card (or an embedded system)
2. How to display things in the Linux world ?
>A>
    - FBDEV: Framebuffer Device
    - DRM/KMS: Direct Rendering Manager / Kernel Mode Setting
    - V4L2: Video for Linux 2
3. How to choose one from above:
>A>
    - Each subsytsem provides its own set of features
    - Different levels of complexity
    - Different levels of activity
4. Why to choose DRM/KMS over other two ?
>A>
    - Actively maintained
    - Provides fine grained control on the display pipeline
    - Widely used by user-space graphic stacks
    - Provides a full set of advanced features
5. Why not FBDEV ?
>A>
    - Less actively maintained
    - Does not provides all the features we needed (overlays, hwcursor, ...)
    - Developers are now encouraged to move to DRM/KMS
6. Why not V4L2 ?
    >A> Well suited for video capture and specific video output devices but not for ”complex” display controllers
7. GPU vs. Graphics Card: What’s the Difference?
>A>
    - While the terms GPU and graphics card (or video card) are often used interchangeably, there is a subtle
    distinction between these terms. Much like a motherboard contains a CPU, a graphics card refers to an add-in board
    that incorporates the GPU. This board also includes the raft of components required to both allow the GPU to
    function and connect to the rest of the system.
    - GPUs come in two basic types: integrated and discrete. An integrated GPU does not come on its own separate card
    at all and is instead embedded alongside the CPU. A discrete GPU is a distinct chip that is mounted on its own
    circuit board and is typically attached to a PCI Express slot.
8. What is Framebuffer ?
9. GEM and TTM - Memory Manager
>A>
    - TTM stands for Translation Table Manager and is a generic memory-manager provided by the kernel.
    It does not provide a common user-space API so you need to look at each driver interface if you want to use it.
    See for instance the radeon manpages for more information on memory-management with radeon and TTM.
    - GEM stands for Graphics Execution Manager and is a generic DRM memory-management framework in the kernel,
    that is used by many different drivers. Gem is designed to manage graphics memory, control access to the graphics
    device execution context and handle essentially NUMA environment unique to modern graphics hardware. Gem allows multiple
    applications to share graphics device resources without the need to constantly reload the entire graphics card.
    Data may be shared between multiple applications with gem ensuring that the correct memory synchronization occurs.
10. What is FourCC (Four character code) ?
    >A> is a 4-byte identifier which specifies the format of a video stream
    - Every codec has its own unique FourCC. Commonly, each byte corresponds to a printable character in the ASCII
    character set, making the sequence human-readable.
    - describes the memory buffer organization
11. What is CRTC (CRT controller) ?
    - Configure the appropriate display settings:
        Display timings
        Display resolution
    - Scan out frame buffer content to one or more displays
    - Update the frame buffer
    - Implemented through struct drm_crtc funcs and struct drm_crtc_helper funcs
