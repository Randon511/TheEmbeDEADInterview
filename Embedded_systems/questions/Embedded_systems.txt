21. Types of Endianness. Difference between them. How to check Endianness using C program. 
22. What is Flash memory ? NAND flash vs NOR flash difference.  
23. Difference bet Asynchronous and Synchronous communication
    >A>
    - No common clk in Async, In sync shared clk
    - Async send 1 byte at a time, sync sends data in form of blocks/frames 
    - Async slower compared to sync 
    - Async can communicate longer distance  
    - Async use start/stop bit for data sync 
    - Async: RS232, RS485   Sync: I2C, SPI
